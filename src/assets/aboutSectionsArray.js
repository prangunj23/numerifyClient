    "This project looks to provide users with access to mathematical resources on the web. This is done by utilizing " +
    "semantic search, a machine learning technique utilizing the vector representation of words. With the Open AI " + 
    "Embeddings API, we were able to gather the vector representation of the transcripts of Youtube's math-related " + 
    "content. For now, the algorithm searches through the content of the Professor Leonard youtube channel with over 1,200 " +
    "videos. Since it was designed to be scalable, we plan to support searching through even more channels soon to provide " +
    "an even wider range of educational math content. We have combined this search engine with a roadmap to indicate which " +
    "topics should be learned next and a calculator to help solve problems encountered along the way.",
    "Our goal is to make the field of mathematics more accessible and understandable for students and anyone else that " +
    "wants to learn more. Many people find themselves stuck on a certain math problem or topic. We want to make those " +
    "tough problems less intimidating, and instead inspire people to improve their problem solving skills. By providing " +
    "the specific time stamp of the concept being searched within a video, we hope to save users the time of clicking " +
    "through videos and trying to find the exact point they need to see. From technology to finance to medicine to just "+
    "about everything else, math is key skill. Hopefully, by using our site, you can learn to embrace it and learn "+
    "something new everyday!"
